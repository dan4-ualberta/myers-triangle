# Myer's Triangle
This code is based off the example for testing created by Glen Myers:
"The program reads three integer values from a card. The three values are interpreted as representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The program prints a message that states whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, equilateral, or invalid."

# Test Case Generation
Test cases were created using the equivalence partitioning method, there is not full coverage of all possible inputs but provides good enough coverage.
Assigning all the possible test cases for equivalence partitioning should not be done as it is impractical.
Be aware that some strongly typed languages do not require specific test cases as exceptions are already raised for them (e.g. Swift raises an error when integer overflow is present).

# TODO
Fix the triangleType method so that all test cases pass.
